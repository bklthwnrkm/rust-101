- This project is automatically created by "cargo new hello_cargo"
  - src/main.rs, Cargo.toml
- In Rust, we call packages crates
- target folder is automatically created by "cargo build"
- main.rs can be executed by ".\target\debug\hello_cargo.exe"
- "cargo run" does build and execute the file all at once
- "cargo check" checks if code can be compiled but doesn't execute it
- "cargo build" has two states, "debug" and "release", the latter one of which can be executed by "cargo build --release"
  - during build --release, it optimizes code
