- Stack

  - last in, first out
  - imagine a stack of plates
    - when you add a new plate, you add it to the top (push)
    - when you remove a plate, you do so from the top likewise (pop)
    - stack is like a plates stacked in this analogy
  - so simple that it doesn't have to look for a place to set data
    - this makes it work swiftly

- Heap

  - imagine when you want to make a reservation for dinner at a restaurant
    - you will tell the staff how many members and then they take you to a seat (seats) vacant
    - if someone of your members comes later, that person can ask them where and find you
    - heap is like a seat (seats) in this analogy
      - where to find a heap(heaps) is pointer, which is like an address
  - used when sizes are unclear when compiling, or they are mutable
  - a lot more complicated and thus slower than Stack, but more flexible
